  This repositroy contains flutter tutorials, with explanations, I've written during my time at Mutiny Studio as a mobile developer. The main scope of these tutorials are to demonstrate internationaisation, lazy loading and communicating with a backend server in Flutter. 
  
  The tutorial projects found in this repository: 
    1.) "Hello World" application:
        Displays a "Hello World" message, demonstrates basic stacks, floating action buttons, AppBars
    2.) Lazy loading a list of items from a JSON fetched from the internet
    3.)Coffee consumption counter(with login using the Google auth APIs, back and forth communication with the backend)
      This project also contains the backend written in aqueduct
